# Getting Started with Create React App

This project consists of a React SPA and a simple web server built with Node.js and Express.  The purpose of this app is to display weather forecast data using the National Weather Service API.

The Application gathers data in two steps.  The first query to the National Weather Service API provides the coordinates that the user has entered.  The application saves the city and state data from this response as well as gridX, gridY, and gridId values.
The user is notified with an alert if they have entered coordinates that are outside the United States.

The gridX, gridY, an gridId parameters are passed into a second API call which provides the actual forecast data.  
If a user has entered coordinates that are within the United States BUT not a supported forecast type (such as marine forecasts in a body of water), the user is notified with an alert.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `node server.js`

Starts the web server.  This web server DOES NOT serve the React app. It is used only the interact with the National Weather Service API.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
